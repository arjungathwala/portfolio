        <h3 style="color: #D4AF37">My Story</h3>
        <p>
        I am a UCSB student double majoring in Electrical Engineeering, B.S., and Data Science and Statistics, B.A.. I decided to double major in Data Science because many people working in the industry believe that big data is going to be the future of technological advancement. I have trained myself to be as ready as possible for my next software engineering role by working on projects and gaining real experience for internships.
        <br><br>
        Since a very young age, I have always enjoyed coming up with creative and artsy solutions to problems. This is reflected not only in my developed interests such as Chess and Discrete Mathematics, but also how I approach life in general. It was this mindset which attracted me to Computer Science and engineering.
        <br><br>
        I am really passionate about helping others as I feel like our purpose as human beings is to help each other however much as possible. I try my best to work on projects that might create a positive impact on others' lives. This is reflected in my COVID projects and PIC.ME application. I have described my experience working on these projects below in the projects section.
        <br><br>
        I have learned a lot about how to develop software applications by working on these projects. However, I have learned just as much, if not more, by working at real internships where I was trained over last two summers to become a better qualified engineer. I feel most grateful to my previous employer, Trianz, where I was trained as a Full-Stack engineer to develop multiple web applications.

        <h3>COVID-19 Tracker Website and AI Bot</h3>
        <p>(www.uscovid19tracker.info) - COVID-19 has affected all of our lives. I and my friend, Eran Naveh, decided to create a website that allows users to generate and compare COVID-19 curves of any U.S. state or county, as well as allowing users to create their own tables. We wanted to use our engineering skills to help our community and this creative project allowed us to do that.
        <br><br>
        I decided to take the website experience to the next level by developing a dispatch tool and multi-threading system based Covid web-chat Bot. The bot leverages cloud-based API services such as Microsoft LUIS and Microsoft QnA Maker that use machine-learning for building enterprise-grade conversational AI experiences. The bot pulls information from WHO database to answer FAQs on COVID, and also deserializes covid count APIs in JSON format to display cases count in the webchat on national and global scale. This project was published on various news websites.</p>

        <h3>PIC.ME</h3>
        <p>This project in particular is very close to my heart. My friend who is persuing a Ph.D. at UCSB resurned from a small village in Peru after working with autistic children with speech impairment. She realized that the current methods in place to assist these children are extremely obsolete and ineffective. Together, we came up with the idea for PIC.ME. 
        <br><br>
        I developed this research-based, personalized Android application that helps autistic children with speech impairment overcome vocal challenges through a special use of media. It consists of multiple folders that consist of personalized information, such as kids' family members' pictures, facorite foods, drinks. The media captured by camera authentication is backed onto Google Firebase storage and can be retrieved.The app also consists of vocal assistance that teaches kids how to begin and end sentences. I am constantly adding features to the app as I go forward. We were one of 27 teams out of 438 competing teams to win UC Berkeley Big Ideas Competition for this project. </p>

        <h3>COVID Prediction Model</h3>
        <p>Computer Science is my greatest passion ever since I came to college. However, Mathematics was my first love. From elegant Discrete Math proofs to vast real world Calculus applications, Math always fascinated me. I decided to use this strength of Mathematics to create my first predictive model by solving set of differential equations.
          <br><br>
        My main objective with this project was to help my community understand how important social distancing is to limit the spread of COVID-19 Pandemic. I used the variable contact ratio to quantify how important social distancing is. During the quarter I made this project, I was taking a Differential Equations course and a Multivariable Calculus course. I turned my set of ordinary differential equations into a set of partial differential equations which depended on time and space. The model was a spinoff from the basic SIR pandemic model with space variable added. Now, with this added variable, pandemic could be viewed as spreading as a wave accross the population. The reason I decided to add space variable is because I feel like space is the most important variable deciding the spread of a pandemic like COVID-19 that is highly contagious. The project was recognized as the best project of the course.</p>

        <h3>Star Wars BB-8 Robot</h3>
        <p>This project is where the kid inside me was able to express himself. Growing up I was a huge Star Wars fan and found all Star Wars droid really cool. I worked on this projects as my first real team project. I enjoyed leading my team of three people to build this really cool robot; it would move around like a ball but its head remains upright on top by use of magnetic force. 
        <br><br>
        I developed a simple android application that sends characters via Bluetooth every time a button is pressed. The Bluetooth module receives the data while the Arduino interprets and processes these data. The Arduino sends signals to the Motor Driver shield to give a go signal for the switching of the motors. We successfully built a functional BB-8 robot that could move around and talk using pre-recorded notes. My greates lesson while working on this project was that not everything goes as planned while working on a team project. I learned how to work with other engineers and manage them in cases I have to lead the project, as I had to do with this project. We won the prize for most innovative and creative project from UCSB ECE department for our work on this project.</p>

        <p>(www.trianz.com) - Trianz is one of the top IT Service Management Firms. It was ranked among Forbes ‘America's Best Management Consulting Firms’ for the 3rd consecutive year this year. I was lucky to work on the Business Apps team as a Full-Stack Developer during my sophomore year summer. Working at Trianz I gained a deep understanding of the fact that customer needs must be the perpetual guiding force behind the design of the product. At Trianz, products are developed using AGILE model.

        I designed, implemented, and deployed the Front and Back-end services of a shopping website. I also implemented a Shopping web-chat Bot using “suggested card” UI and multi-threading system based Dialog Model. I integrated this bot into the shopping website. I leveraged cloud-based API services such as LUIS and Microsoft QnA Maker that use machine-learning intelligence for building enterprise-grade conversational AI experiences. I stored Conversation History, User Profile and Telemetry data using Azure Storage Account. All the bot code was developed code in .NET Core 3.1 framework using SOLID/OOPS principles such as dependency injection and interfaces.
